				<h2>Genral Advice</h2>
				<p>Thoughts to bear in mind which can apply both inside and outside meet events.</p>

				<ul class="faqlist">
					<li>Remember to bring photo I.D.</li>
					<li>Make sure you have all belongings before leaving an area.</li>
					<li>Beware of all Ceilings, Floors and Furniture when moving(e.g. don’t make prop shaped holes).</li>
					<li>Take suitable footwear you don’t mind getting dirty.</li>
					<li>Wash! , Being nervous and wearing black you will sweat. Have a good shower and perfume everything. So body odor has lesser chance ruining peoples fun.</li>
					<li>Be polite, Ask before taken photos, expect the odd photo invasion.</li>
					<li>Photo size is best minimum of 2048 x 1152. Preset <a href="http://digicamhelp.com/camera-features/camera-modes/high-sensitivity-mode/">ISO</a> as having it set to Auto or to high may result in various image size results. Beware sharing on sites like facebook will also reduce the image size.</li>
					<li>Take photos of both solo and groups as when you see people and when they are willing.</li>
					<li>If someone is too much of a nuisance in every photo, ask them nicely to stop.</li>
					<li>If Hosting your first event. It a good idea to communicate with the local Council, Police and nearby Venue Owners, Practically if no cosplay event has occurred there recently. Let them know the place, dates and time. Then if passerby thinks the props are real weapons and reports to the police they should maybe send like 2 officers to check instead of 5 cars.</li>
					<li>Being in Cosplay is no reason to be sexual harrised or bullied by others. Indeed no one should put up such treatment. No matter how Immature, important or expert someone appears to be. If that someone treats you in away that makes you feel worthless or at risk of being hurt or kidnapped. Make Event organisers, Friends, Random persons aware. Have someone ask them to stop. Get somewhere you feel safe. If they are touching or hurt  in a way not appreciated, Shout out. Cause a scene. Have someone involve the police <strong>101.</strong> <a href="http://cosplayisnotconsent.tumblr.com/">Cosplay is Not Consent</a>, <a href="http://i-cosplay.org/">I Cosplay Anti-Bullying</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rYXZitftQ8g0jHRhQLdHZDxW4EfS-L4S1-D5jcAHILs/pub">A Member's Story</a></li>
					<li>Unsure about something?, Something not working? Ask first. Make sure you ask someone who knows. Don’t keep throwing money and hoping it will work.</li>
					<li>Chairs & Tables are not designed for standing on or leaning against.</li>
					<li>Practice the countryside code.</li>
					<li>Look both ways before crossing a road.</li>
